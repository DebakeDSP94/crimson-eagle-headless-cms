<h2 className="sb-unstyled mt-4 mb-2 text-2xl text-zinc-500 uppercase">
	Frontend:
</h2>

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">1)</h3>

-   Create project structure and set up Next.js development environment.
-   Implement basic layout and navigation for the administrative interface using the "shadcn" component library.
-   Create a placeholder login page with a form to sign in using username/email and password.

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">2)</h3>

-   <s>Implement JWT token-based authentication on the backend.</s>
-   Connect the frontend login page to the backend API endpoint /auth/login to authenticate the user and retrieve the token.
-   <s>Store the token securely (e.g., in local storage) for subsequent API requests.</s>

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">3)</h3>

-   Design and create the users list page in the admin dashboard.
-   Fetch the list of users from the backend API endpoint /user using the stored token.
-   Display the users in a data table with pagination, filtering by username, and sorting.

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">4)</h3>

-   Implement the functionality to select and delete multiple users.
-   Add a delete button to the users list page, which triggers a confirmation prompt listing the selected users' IDs, usernames, and emails.
-   Connect the delete button to the backend API endpoint /user/[id] to delete the selected users.

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">5)</h3>

-   Create the add/edit user page with a form for adding/editing user data.
-   Implement form validation on the frontend for required fields and other relevant constraints.
-   Connect the form submission to the backend API endpoint /user to add a new user or /user/[id] to update an existing user.

	Backend:
</h2>

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">1)</h3>

-   <s>Set up the .NET Core development environment.</s>
-   <s>Create the API endpoint /auth/login to authenticate the user and generate a JWT token upon successful login.</s>

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">2)</h3>

-   Implement the API endpoint /user with the GET method to fetch a list of users (authorized only for logged-in users with appropriate permissions).

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">3)</h3>

-   Implement the API endpoint /user with the POST method to add a new user (authorized only for logged-in users with appropriate permissions).
-   Validate the request body data and return any validation errors if necessary.

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">4)</h3>

-   Implement the API endpoint /user/[id] with the GET method to fetch a specific user's data by ID (authorized only for logged-in users with appropriate permissions).

<h3 className="sb-unstyled text-xl text-zinc-400">5)</h3>

-   Implement the API endpoint /user/[id] with the PUT method to update an existing user's data (authorized only for logged-in users with appropriate permissions).
-   Validate the request body data and return any validation errors if necessary.

<h2 className="sb-unstyled text-2xl text-zinc-500">Deployment:</h2>

-   Deploy the frontend code to Vercel or a desired hosting environment.
-   Deploy the backend code to Fly.io or a preferred hosting service.

**End of Phase 1:**

The user management functionality, including login, user list, add/edit user, and delete user, is implemented on both the frontend and backend.

The frontend is deployed to Vercel, and the backend is deployed to Fly.io.

MVP of the headless CMS with user management is ready for testing and further development.

Note: During this timeframe, the frontend and backend developers will work in tandem, with the frontend using a dummy API placeholder until the backend API endpoints are finished.
